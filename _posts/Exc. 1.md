# Distribution and photo-physiology of coral communities across the depth gradient in the Red Sea reefs of Eilat. 

## ** Data collecting conduction notes: **

### <ins>Sampling dates:

12th to 15th July 2022 in 6 dives with closed circuit system on scuba dives.

### <ins>Dive sites:

1. "Coral Beach Nature Reserve" (NR) - “Japanese Gardens” (29 deg.30’18”N, 34 deg.55’16”E)

2. Interuniversity Institute north entry - “IUI North” (29 deg.30'10", 34 deg.55’06”E)

3. Interuniversity Institute south entry - “IUI South” (29 deg.30’06”N, 34 deg.55’03”E)

Depth-points in each dive: at five depths: 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 m.

### <ins>Part 1 - Benthic communities’ characterization:

Photo-quadrats were taken on the same depth contour line. 

In some photos there was a small deviation (1-2m) from the exact depth, because of uneven bathymetry. 

Between every two photos a swim of 20 seconds was maintained. 

This process was then repeated at all other depths. 

In total 464 photo-quadrats (1 sqm in size) were taken: approximately 30 in each depth.

Photos were taken using a Nikon D850 Camera with Sea & Sea strobes to light the area of the quadrat. 

The camera was parallel to the reef bottom, centered and fixed on top of the quadrat PVC-pipe frame. 

Depth gauge was attached to the frame for depth measurement. 

### <ins>Part 2 - Light physiology and environment:

At the same three sites as above and same depth-points In-situ fluorometry data was collected.

In each depth-point, 3-7 colonies (presence-depended) of five key-target corals (list below) were measured.

Measurement of active fluorescence was done using Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation fluorometer (FIRe).

The FIRe fluorometer measures chlorophyll-a fluorescence in photosystem Ⅱ (PSⅡ) of photosynthetic organisms using Variable Fluorescence (Fv). 

The sampling cycle takes few seconds and includes two phases: 

In the first phase, the dark measurement, a strong short pulse of 100 µs duration is given to saturate PSⅡ's reactions centers.

In the second phase, under ambient light, a weaker modulated light (for 500 ms) is applied to record the relaxation kinetics of fluorescence yield.

The FIRe records: temperature (deg.C), and PAR (uE/m^2/s).

(The intensity of background ambient light PAR is automatically adjusted for each sample to ensure optimal measurements under ambient light). 

Among the photosynthetic parameters measured with the FIRe device: 

Fv/Fm ratio – quantum yield of photosynthesis in PSⅡ recorded in dark and under ambient light. 

Sigma σ PSⅡ – the functional absorption cross section of PSⅡ (A^2).

p – connectivity factor that defining the probability of excitation energy transfer between individual photosynthetic units (dimensionless).

Pmax – maximum photosynthetic rate (electron/sec) at PSⅡ.

Post-dive the FIRe device connected to a computer in order to download and save data. 

### <ins>Target-species:

Five symbiotic hard corals that are abundant in GoE/A along the depth gradient were selected. 

The selection was based on differing depth specification: 

Two of the corals are depth-generalist's species: Stylophora pistallata and Porites spp.

One species which is shallow water specific: Pocillopora spp.

Two species that are deep water specific: Alveopora spp. and Leptoseris spp. 

In each colony measured, the data collected included five readings by using the "Fiber Light Guide" of the FIRe instrument.

The replicates readings in the same colony account for light differences inside the colony: one reading of each side of the colony, and one from the top.
